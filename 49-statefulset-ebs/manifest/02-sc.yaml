  iopsPerGB: '50' # I/O operations per second per GiB. Can be specified for IO1, IO2, and GP3 volumes.
  # blockExpress: "false" # Default: false. Enables the creation of io2 Block Express volumes by increasing the IOPS limit for io2 volumes to 256000. Volumes created with more than 64000 IOPS will fail to mount on instances that do not support io2 Block Express.
  # iops: 500 # I/O operations per second. Can be specified for IO1, IO2, and GP3 volumes.
  encrypted: 'true' # Default: false
  # kmsKeyId: arn # The full ARN of the key to use when encrypting the volume. If not specified, AWS will use the default KMS key for the region the volume is in. This will be an auto-generated key called /aws/ebs if not changed.
  # throughput: 125 # Throughput in MiB/s. Only effective when gp3 volume type is specified. Default: 125
