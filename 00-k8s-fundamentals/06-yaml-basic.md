# ✅ Imperative vs Declarative

- Imperative: Explicit instructions. The system is stupid, you are smart.
- Declarative: Define outcome. The system is smart, you don't care.

## Example of Imperative:

```
kubectl run vietpod1 --image vietaws/eks:v1
```

## Example of Declarative:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: vietpod1
    tier: free
    type: manual
  name: vietpod1
spec:
  containers:
  - image: vietaws/eks:v1
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: vietpod1
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
